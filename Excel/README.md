# Excel Pre work

## Activity

* Using the Fill Handle, fill up `Column A` with the numbers 1 to 150. 

* Give it a named range of "First150"

## Activity

* **Part 1**

  * Place two numbers into cells A2 and B2. These values will be those that you use to perform your calculations.

  * In cell D2, create a formula that adds A2 and B2 together.

  * In cell D5, create a formula that subtracts B2 from A2.

  * In cell D8, create a formula that multiplies B2 and A2 together.

  * In cell D11, create a formula that divides A2 by B2.

* **Part 2**

  * Place a new number into cell F2. This third number will be used in the functions listed below.

  * Create a formula in H2 that adds the value of A2 to the difference between B2 and F2.

  * Create a formula in H5 that multiplies the value of A2 by the sum of B2 and F2.

  * Create a formula in H8 that divides the value of A2 by the product of B2 and F2.

  * Create a formula in H11 that takes the sum of B2 and F2 and subtracts that from the value of A2.

## Activity 

* Using [Yearly Sale](Resources/YearlySales_Starter.xls) complete the following.

  * Using a built-in formula, find the total sales for the year.

  * Using a built-in formula, find the average sales per month for the year.

  * Using a built-in formula, find the greatest number of sales this year.

    * You will want to look up the `MAX()` function for this.

  * Using a built-in formula, find the lowest number of sales this year.

    * You will want to look up the `MIN()` function for this.
* Create a formula that determines the change in sales month-to-month (Monthly Change). That is, calculate the increase in sales (%) from Jan to Feb, Feb to Mar, etc.

   * Since there is no built-in function for this, you will have to use a mathematic formula to accomplish these tasks.

  * Create a formula that determines the change in sales from January to the current month (Total Change). For example, The total % change from January to August.
